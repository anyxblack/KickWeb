            "Jazz I The Teacher", declared Techno pioneere Juan Atkins. Longstanding UK Detroit enthusiast B12 share those sentiments, but have gone a step further and named names. In place of the ambiguous, futuristic titels like "Cymetry" and "Pracxtopia" with which the duo of Mike Golding and Steve Rutter usually label their music, their ne 3EP disc contains three tracks titeled in homage to a trio of jazz heroes: "Dave Brubeck", "Joe Morelle" and "Ron Carter". "We thought we'd bring in some of the jazz stuff we listened to", says Golding at his home in Walthamstow, North London. "We've got quite substantial record collection of that stuff, so we brought ourselves a sampler and thought, let's go"
            <br>
            The EP makes a departure from the keyboard anti-sampling approach that defines most of their music to date. On "DAve Brubeck", the warm synth pads are demoted in the mix in favour of a Junglist tomb-slam of a bass drum and snare trill, while "Ron Carter's dark mushy analogue synths lurk beneath the bright ride cymbal hits of the damoked drum break. "Our objection to sampled music was always thet the sample can often become the track" clarifies Golding. "We've always sampled things but we've tried to make them unrecohnisable as samples. What we've done on this EP is put a lot of work in so the sample doesn't become the majority of the track."

            A more contemporary influence on B12's new music resides in the intricate microrhythms that characterise Rupert Parkes's Photek productions - a neat closing of the circle, as Parkes once named B12 as a prome influence on his hoen early Techno tracks. "He stood out for us because he gets more layers into the things he does," explains Goldung. "Some of the drum 'n' bass stuff is just too rar, but he geta a lot more feeling into it. The chopping uo of breaks he does is amating. It's probably more difficult and more creative to do that tan it is to pull out a drum machine and create some interesting patterns."

            The new material is the antithesis of the pure systems music with which B12 made their reputation. Initially inspired by the tough Brooklyn Techno of DJ Frankie Bones's Bonesbreaks senes, the duo began releasing trachs in 1991, soon into a more Detroit-inflicted style which was totally at odds with the post-rave Happy Hardcore productions which then ruled UK club culture. In fact the duo's importstyle shrink-wrapped record sleeves, and exotic production aliases such as Redcekk and Musicology, fooled many into thinking their trachs had been produced in the Motor City itself. In a 1993 interview, the duo were partrayed as zealous curators of a tradition of 'proper' Techno, and quoted as saying that Underground Resistance, "with their drug noise", had "deviated" from the music's true path. Do they still hold such 'heretical' views? "There's a place fot everyone to do their thing," qualifies Golding "In that context we were talking about Detroit people and we just said they're not making what we's consider Techno. We're not really into hard Techno because we consider it solely club-based music. It's not slagging them off, it's just that they've moved away, but the same will probably be said about us now."

            B12 found somthing of a niche with the rise of 'Intelligent' Techno in 1994, just as the more diffuse electronic music of The Black Dog, Aphex Twin and others was beginning to establish an audience. This new 'genre' was defined by the Warp label's Artificial Intelligence senes B12's constribution to the series, 1993's Electro Soma LP, had it's halcyon moments, such as "Soundtrack Of Space", with it's celestial, elongated chords, but it also featured more Detroit-influenced tracks like "Obsessed", in which the square waveform bassline echoed the dynamics of Dernck May's Rythim tracks such as "Wiggin" or "It is What It is".
            <br>
            The LP went on to sell 25,000 copies, but B12 had no interest in embracing the screne "We made it clear we were not interested in whtat the perception ot the music was", says Golding "To us it wasn't Ambient, Electronic Listening Music or Intelligent REchno - it was just Techno We weren't following trends we were just doing the music we love".
            <br>    
            By the time of their second LP for Warp, 1996's Time Tounst, their influences seemed to habe broadened "DB5" paralleled the luscious Orientalisms of contemporaneous tracks by The Black Dog, while "Radiophnic Workshop" hinted at an older, buned English tradition of proto-Electronica currently being revived by groips such as Add N to X "Making sure that your influences remain slightly diverse doesn't necessary make you lose the feel of your music", argues Golding "With the new Ep, I'd like to think that people who listened to Electro Soma and Time Tourist can see there's something og the old B12 here rather than it being such a large swing away that it's unrecognisable.
            <br>
            "I don't know if 'Techno' applies to us anymore", he concludes "Not because we've changed as people, but because what Techno means to us has changed. But we'll still carry on making the music we love - we^re not about to become pop stars"
